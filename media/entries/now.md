This is to serve as an overview of me, right now.

# Life
* Trying to get the most out of each day with my wife and kids.
* Busily working to getting the baby's room ready for when he hits 6 months.
* Gaming a lot in my free time, as one does.
# Work
* Working at [Signal](https://signal.org) making the android app awesome!
* Super proud to have worked on and released the new usernames feature.
* I've got a side thing I'm trying to get off the ground but we'll see what kind of time and mental capacity I have for it this year.
# Gaming
* I've been a gamer since I was a kid. It's a wonderful way for me to unwind at the end of a long day.
* I'm a very competitive person, so I try to scratch that itch when I can via fighting games.
* Current competitive games
  * Tekken 8 (Lars)
  * Guilty Gear Strive (Sin)
* Current casual games
  * Helldivers 2
  * Dave the Diver
* Current RPG
  * Yakuza: Infinite Wealth
# Music
* I'm not currently making music, due to time constraints elsewhere in life.
* If you'd like to check out things I've made in the past, you can see my soundcloud profile [here](https://soundcloud.com/user-102402905)
* I'm currently listening to a lot of Periphery and Synthwave.
* I implore everyone to go check out Sleep Token as well, they are incredible.
# Reading
* On a bit of a reading haitus until our little one is sleeping in his own room.
* Current / Up Next

# Writing

* You're in the right place though! And if you want to keep tabs on whether I start again, please feel free to [susbscribe to my atom feed](https://www.ahart.dev/feed.atom)
# Dreaming
* My hope for 2024 is one of growth.
  * Mental growth, and developing my growth mindset.
  * Family growth (not in number, but in that my children are happy and healthy)
  * Financial growth, as we try to brace against rising interest rates and the like
  * Physical growth, as I hope to start eating better, not eating at night, and generally taking better care of myself.
