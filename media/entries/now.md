This is to serve as an overview of me, right now.

# Life
* Trying to get the most out of each day with my wife and kids!

# Work

* A couple really exciting new features in the works at Signal!
* Still chipping away at my side thing, just very slowly.
# Gaming
* I've been a gamer since I was a kid. It's a wonderful way for me to unwind at the end of a long day.
* I'm a very competitive person, so I try to scratch that itch when I can via fighting games.
* Current competitive game
  * Tekken 8 (Nina, maybe Fahkumram)
* Current casual games
  * Road Craft
  * Slay the Spire
* Current RPG
  * Expedition 33
# Music

* I'm currently listening to a lot of Periphery and Synthwave.
* I implore everyone to go check out Sleep Token as well, they are incredible.
# Reading
* On a bit of a reading haitus until our little one is sleeping in his own room.

# Writing

# Dreaming
* My hope for 2025 is one of growth.
  * Mental growth, and developing my growth mindset.
  * Family growth (not in number, but in that my children are happy and healthy)
  * Financial growth, as we try to brace against... ya know...
  * Physical growth, as I hope to start eating better, not eating at night, and generally taking better care of myself.
