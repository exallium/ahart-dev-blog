This is to serve as an overview of me, right now.

# Life
* We welcomed our second little boy back in October 2023
* We got solar panels last fall and I'm excited to see how they function when the sun comes back out
* The days are spent either working or with my family. As are the nights!
* Working at home is such a blessing because I get to see my little ones develop first hand.
# Work
* Working at [Signal](https://signal.org) making the android app awesome!
* Currently hard at work making sure we are ready for a big feature launch very soon!
* Currently on parental leave, and enjoying spending lots of time with my family.
* I've got a side thing I'm trying to get off the ground but we'll see what kind of time and mental capacity I have for it this year.
# Play
* I am huge into video games and have been since I was a kid
* My Steam Deck has proven invaluable while we are finding our footing with the new baby
* I have a personal goal to generally improve at fighting games, so I've mainly been playing them.
  * Tekken 8 (playing Lars)
  * Guilty Gear Strive (playing Sin)
  * Street Fighter 6 (playing Cammy)
  * GranBlue Fantasy Versus Rising (playing Belial)
* Also playing a lot of RPGs and looking forward to them.
  * Yakuza: The Man who Erased his Name
  * Yakuza: Infinite Wealth
  * Persona 3 Reload
  * FF7 Rebirth
  * Rise of the Ronin
# Music
* I'm not currently making music, due to time constraints elsewhere in life.
* If you'd like to check out things I've made in the past, you can see my soundcloud profile [here](https://soundcloud.com/user-102402905)
* I'm currently listening to a lot of Periphery and Synthwave.
* I implore everyone to go check out Sleep Token as well, they are incredible.
# Reading
* I am currently reading "The Sunlit Man" by Brandon Sanderson
* Up next is going to be "The Will to Keep Winning" by Daigo Umehara
* After that I'll be reading "Doom Guy" by John Romero
* Looking forward to book 5 of the Stormlight Archives due out in November!
# Writing
* I'm not currently writing, due to time constraints elsewhere in life.
* You're in the right place though! And if you want to keep tabs on whether I start again, please feel free to [susbscribe to my atom feed](https://www.ahart.dev/feed.atom)
# Dreaming
* My hope for 2024 is one of growth.
  * Mental growth, and developing my growth mindset.
  * Family growth (not in number, but in that my children are happy and healthy)
  * Financial growth, as we try to brace against rising interest rates and the like
  * Physical growth, as I hope to start eating better, not eating at night, and generally taking better care of myself.
