Hi! I'm Alex.

For the last several years, I've been helping to make the world a more secure and 
private place working at Signal. Before that, I worked at a medium sized consultancy
in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I am a developer, father, musician, and gamer, and 
currently reside in beautiful Dieppe, New Brunswick.

In my journey to become the best developer I can be, I've decided to start 
collecting and writing about different topics that developers of all skill 
levels may find interesting. I hope that the words you find here inspire you
to strive to be your best as well.

If you have questions about the content on this site, or just want to say 
"Hi!", the best way to get in touch with me is on Mastodon via the link in my
